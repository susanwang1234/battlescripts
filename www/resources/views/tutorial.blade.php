	  <h1>How to Play</h1>
	  <p><i>Battlescripts</i> is a two-player coding card game. Each player will have 5 cards to play from each turn.</p>

	  <p> <img class="format" src="/images/interface.png" width="70%"/>The cards essentially blocks of code which will be added to that player's program. Players take turns drawing and playing cards from a deck, with the choice of executing, storing, or building on each turn. They may strengthen themself, powerup attacks on opponents, or have the option of storing useful blocks of code. <br><br><i>FOO</i> and <i>BAR</i> bars are the life points, and energy points of each player. Everytime the player executes a program, it will consume a certain amount of <i>BAR</i> points for each piece of code added. BAR will be replenished at the start of each turn. Each player starts with zero bugs and when one player overflows the other player's points (either over or under), then their bugs amount will increase by one.</p>
	  <p>Win the game by overflowing your opponent until you get three bugs, or by setting your bars exactly to zero. If both players have three bugs at the same time, the game continues until one player has more bugs than the other at the end of the turn. If both players Foo or Bar are zero at the end of the game continues until only one player has zero Foo, Bar, or the most bugs.</p>
